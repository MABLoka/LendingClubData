# Lending Club Data Quality & Lineage Dashboard

This project simulates a real-world data management pipeline using Lending Club's loan dataset. It focuses on identifying data quality issues, tracking lineage from raw ingestion to reporting, and visualizing insights through Power BI. The goal is to demonstrate practical data governance skills relevant to roles in data quality, metadata management, and financial data analysis.
